# üéô Communication Style

Superciety is made of builders. Every one of us represents Superciety & every one of us brings their own personality into the writings. This is why it's essential for us to have a shared set of public communication guidelines, in order for Superciety to not be categorized as a schizophrenic.

- **Lowercase**: Write transient messages like tweets in all lowercase

  ‚ùå We are Superciety and we are Community Project.

  ‚úÖ we are superciety and we are a community project.

- **Relevance**: Only communicate what is relevant and valuable to the audience.

- **Brevity**: Remove all filler words and strip down sentences to their core.

  ‚ùå We always work to build a better society for the people.

  ‚úÖ We are building for the people.

- **User-centric**: Talk to the user, not to the crowd.

  ‚ùå We work to make everyone powerful.

  ‚úÖ We work to make you powerful.

- **Simplicity**: Use simple language that anybody can understand.

- **Confidence**: Speak in statements.

- **Formatting**: Use space and avoid walls of text.

- **Branding**: Reinforce branding with recurring messages.

  ‚úÖ welcome to superciety; expect us; this is superciety; by the people, for the people

- **Emojis**: Use emojis to guide the reader & invoke images in the mind, not to express emotion.

- **Emphasis**: CAPITALIZE words you want to emphasize

- **Avoid excessive tagging**: Only use relevant hashtags & relevant user mentions to avoid looking needy or spammy.

  ‚ùå anyone can be a part of superciety.

  ‚úÖ ANYONE can be a part of superciety.

This, builders of Superciety, is Superciety.
